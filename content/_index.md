Antwerp, Belgium</b></h3>

The Computational Humanities Research (CHR) community is an international and
interdisciplinary community that supports researchers with an interest in computational
approaches to the humanities. 

The 2022 edition of the Computational Humanities Research conference will be
hosted by the University of Antwerp, Belgium. The conference will be a hybrid
event with an option to attend in person at the beautiful [Monastery of the
Grauwzusters](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/about-uantwerp/campuses/catering-conventionhalls/convention-halls/klooster-grauwzusters/)
in Antwerp, virtually, or a combination of the two. Check the [Call for
Papers](/cfp)!

### Keynote Speakers

We are very honoured and pleased that Nina Tahmasebi and Peter Turchin have accepted to
give a keynote lecture at CHR2022.

                  <p>Nina Tahmasebi is an Associate Professor in NLP at the University of Gothenburg. She works
                     at a Language Technology Research Lab, Spr√•kbanken Text. During the
                     past years, she also worked for the Centre for Digital Humanities. Her
                     research focuses on computational methods for detecting changes in
                     natural language, in particular semantic changes and lexical
                     replacements.

         <p>Peter Turchin is a complexity scientist who works in the field of historical social science that he and his colleagues call Cliodynamics. His research interests lie at the intersection of social and cultural evolution, historical macrosociology, economic history, mathematical modeling of long-term social processes, and the construction and analysis of historical databases.</p>
